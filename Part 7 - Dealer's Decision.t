%Program Name: Vegas BlackJack
%Date: May 20, 2011
%Program Description: This program allows the user to bet and play BlackJack against an AI(Artifical Intelligence) dealer. The user
% can hit to be dealt cards, and stand to stay, and the computer would then deal cards to itself and would automatically stand on 17 or higher.
% The values of the cards are then compared, and the winner is determined, and either the user wins the bet or loses it. The game ends when the
% user's account has $0 remaining. It would then appear as "Game Over! Thank you for playing."
